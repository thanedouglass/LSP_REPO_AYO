# Object-Oriented Redesign of ETL Pipeline
This Java program implements a redesign of my previous ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that processes product data from a CSV file, applies various transformations, and outputs the transformed data to a new CSV file.

**How To Run**
1. Compile the Java program:
```java
javac src/org/howard/edu/lsp/assignment3/*.java
```
2. Run the compiled program:
```java
java -cp src org.howard.edu.lsp.assignment3.ETLPipeline
```

**Assumptions**
1. Input file (data/products.csv) exists in the specified location relative to the project root
2. Input CSV format follows: ProductID, Name, Price, Category
3. Price values are valid decimal numbers that can be parsed by BigDecimal
4. ProductID values are valid integers
5. The first row of the input file is a header that should be skipped
6. Empty lines in the input file should be skipped
7. Malformed rows should be skipped but processing should continue

**Design Notes**
+ **Extraction:** Reads data from products.csv using a BufferedReader, skipping the header and any empty lines.
+ **Transformation:**
  + Converts product names to uppercase.
  + Applies a 10% discount to Electronics products.
  + Recategorizes high-value electronics (priced over $500.00 after discount) as Premium Electronics.
  + Calculates and adds a new PriceRange field based on final price.
+ **Loading:** Writes the transformed data to transformed_products.csv with a new PriceRange column.
+ **Precision:** Uses BigDecimal with RoundingMode.HALF_UP for accurate monetary calculations and rounding.
+ **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles a missing input file and skips any malformed data rows.

### **Testing Strategy**
The program was tested with two primary cases to ensure robustness and correctness.

**Normal Input:** A standard products.csv file with a mix of product data was used to verify that all transformations (name conversion, discount, recategorization, and price range calculation) were applied correctly. The output was validated against a golden file to ensure accuracy.

**Edge Cases:**

+ *Empty Input File*: The program was tested with a products.csv file that contained only the header row to ensure it gracefully handles this scenario by producing a new file with only the header row.

+ *File Not Found*: The program was tested without the products.csv file present to confirm it handles missing input gracefully and provides a clear error message.

+ *Malformed Rows*: Malformed rows (e.g., missing columns or invalid number formats) were added to the input file to ensure they are skipped and do not cause the program to crash.

**Usage:** Borrowed the use of BigDecimal with RoundingMode.HALF_UP to ensure accurate and reliable rounding of floating-point numbers for monetary values, avoiding precision issues inherent with double or float.

**Usage:** The try-with-resources statement is used to automatically manage the BufferedReader and BufferedWriter streams. This common Java practice ensures that resources are closed properly, preventing potential memory leaks and file corruption

**Link:** https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html

**Usage:** Used BigDecimal class for precise decimal arithmetic operations, specifically for price calculations and discount applications to avoid floating-point precision errors common with primitive types.

**Link:** https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/BufferedReader.html

**Usage:** Implemented BufferedReader for efficient reading of the input CSV file, handling large files with optimal performance through buffered input operations.

# Documentation of AI Usage
**Initial Problem:**  After successfully compiling the ETLPipeline.java program, I encountered a ClassNotFoundException when trying to run it from the command line. My initial attempts with different command flags (-d ., -d bin) resulted in the program creating a whole new org/ folder at the project root, which was not the intended behavior.

**My Prompt:**  i need the compiler to place the compiled output in the assignment2 folder src/org/howard/edu/lsp/assignment2/

**AIâ€™s Response Excerpt:** The AI's response explained that to get the compiled .class file to be in the same directory as the .java file, I needed to change my current working directory to the assignment2 folder and run a simple javac command without any destination flags.

**Modification and Usage:** I learned to manage my directory context before compiling. By running cd src/org/howard/edu/lsp/assignment2/ and then javac ETLPipeline.java, the .class file was correctly placed within the assignment2 directory. I then returned to the project root and used the java -cp src ... command, which correctly told the JVM to find the compiled code within the src directory. This process resolved the original error and taught me a crucial lesson about the relationship between javac, java, and the project's file structure.
