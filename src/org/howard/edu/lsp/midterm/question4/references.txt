Reference Transcript for Question 4: Smart-Campus Device System

This document contains a transcript of the user's questions and the provided answers regarding the Java file structure and implementation correctness for the smart-campus device system.

Topic 1: Implementation Correctness

User Question:

"do the two above classes correctly extend the following [abstract Device class and interface specifications]?"

Gemini Response:

Yes, the DoorLock, Thermostat, and Camera classes I provided correctly extend the abstract Device class and implement the Networked and BatteryPowered interfaces according to all the rules you've outlined.

Here is a point-by-point confirmation:

Inheritance: Each concrete class correctly uses the syntax extends Device (e.g., public class DoorLock extends Device...).

Constructor Chain: The first line in the constructor of DoorLock, Thermostat, and Camera is super(id, location);, which correctly calls the constructor of the Device base class.

Interface Implementation:

DoorLock and Camera correctly state that they implements Networked, BatteryPowered.

Thermostat correctly states that it implements Networked.

Method Overriding: All required methods from the interfaces (connect, disconnect, etc.) and the abstract base class (getStatus) are properly implemented with the @Override annotation in each respective class.

Behavior Adherence: The logic inside the implemented methods strictly follows the behavior specified in the instructions. For example, setBatteryPercent correctly throws an IllegalArgumentException for out-of-range values, and the connect/disconnect methods properly use the setConnected protected method from the Device class.

In summary, the implementation adheres to all the specified requirements for inheritance and interface implementation.

Topic 2: Repository File Structure

User Question:

"in my repo under question 4 there should only be 2 java scripts?"

Gemini Response:

No, for question 4 you will need a total of seven .java files in your repository under the org/howard/edu/lsp/midterm/question4/ directory.

Here is the complete list of files required to build the smart-campus device system as specified:

Device.java (The abstract base class)

Networked.java (The interface for network capabilities)

BatteryPowered.java (The interface for battery capabilities)

DoorLock.java (A concrete device class)

Thermostat.java (A concrete device class)

Camera.java (A concrete device class)

Main.java (The provided driver class to run and test the system)

Verify Your Directory Structure
Before running any commands, make sure all seven .java files (Device.java, Networked.java, BatteryPowered.java, DoorLock.java, Thermostat.java, Camera.java, and Main.java) are located inside the correct folder structure that matches the package name.

Starting from your project's source root (e.g., a folder named src),
