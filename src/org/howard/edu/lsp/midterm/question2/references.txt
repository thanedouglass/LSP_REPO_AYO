Transcript for AreaCalculator Correction

Here is a summary of the debugging session for the AreaCalculator class.

User Input / Error Message:

The user attempted to compile the Java files and received the following error:

@thanedouglass âžœ /workspaces/LSP_REPO_AYO/src (main) $ javac org/howard/edu/lsp/midterm/question2/Main.java
./org/howard/edu/lsp/midterm/question2/AreaCalculator.java:3: error: class, interface, or enum expected
ublic class AreaCalculator {
^
1 error


Analysis and Fix:

You've found a classic typo! That's an excellent job of spotting the error message and providing it.

The error message class, interface, or enum expected on the line ublic class AreaCalculator { points directly to the problem.

The Cause of the Error: The compiler is telling you that it was expecting to see a keyword like public, class, interface, etc., but instead, it saw ublic. The letter 'p' is missing from the public keyword in your AreaCalculator.java file.

The Fix: This is a very simple fix. You just need to add the 'p' back to the beginning of the line.

Next Steps: Replace the content of your AreaCalculator.java with the corrected code below. Then, run the same javac and java commands again from your project's root directory (src).

Final Corrected Code: AreaCalculator.java
